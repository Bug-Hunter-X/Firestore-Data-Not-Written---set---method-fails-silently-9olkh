# Firestore Data Not Written - Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue in Firebase Firestore where the `set()` method appears to succeed without throwing errors, yet the data is not written to the database.  The problem is investigated and a solution is provided.

## Problem Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to write data to a Firestore document using the `set()` method. Despite the apparent success (no errors are reported), the data does not appear in the Firestore console.  This happens even when security rules are properly configured.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution to this issue. Often, this issue can stem from incorrect usage of asynchronous operations and promises. The solution adds additional checks to confirm the data is written correctly.  It might also involve checking for potential conflicts or rate limiting.
